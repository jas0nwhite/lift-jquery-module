To publish use the publish.sh script, to change to a local publish replace 'publish-signed' with 'publish-local-signed' in respective publish script.

As of v2.9 builds against Lift 2.5 is no longer supported. 

./project/autobuildscript/publish.sh -t [2.5,2.6,3.0]

The build script will make sure the correct JDK is set and execute one of the following 
sbt command files depending on chosen input (target) parameter.

Target Lift 2.5 (java6, Scala 2.9.1, 2.9.1-1, 2.9.2, 2.10)
sbt < project/autobuildscript/build-publish-Lift25.txt > build.log | tail -f build.log

Current target Lift 2.6 (java6 Scala 2.9.1, 2.9.1-1, 2.9.2, 2.10, 2.11)
sbt < project/autobuildscript/build-publish-Lift26.txt > build.log | tail -f build.log

Target Lift 3.x (OBS! use java8 Scala 2.11)
sbt < project/autobuildscript/build-publish-Lift3.txt > build.log | tail -f build.log
